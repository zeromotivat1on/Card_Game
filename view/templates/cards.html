                    <span class="descr">Description:<br><span class="descr"></span>Bishop (real name Lucas Bishop) is a fictional superhero in Marvel comics and its universe, 
                    and appears mainly in the X-Men comics. He is an alpha-level mutant who has the ability to absorb energy 
                    and direct it towards his targets, and possess other abilities such as letting his "spirit go".
                    Bishop was a member of Xavier's Security Enforcers (initially called the Xavier School Enforcers), 
                    a mutant police force from a dystopian future of the Marvel Universe. He traveled to the 20th century and joined the X-Men, 
                    a team he knew only as legends. A brash antihero, he had difficulty adjusting to the norms of the time period. 
                    After a decade and a half of acting as a member of the team, Bishop was instead portrayed as one of the X-Men's main antagonists.</span></span><br>
